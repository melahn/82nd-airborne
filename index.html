<h1>82nd Airborne Division Historical Documents from World War 2</h1>
<p>
This project contains historical documents 
related to the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division in 
World War 2.
<p>
To quote from one of the documents:
<blockquote>
"In the course of these operations the 82nd Airborne Division became the first American Airborne Division in action and the only Airborne Division to
fight in two Theaters of Operations (the North African
or Mediterranean, and the European Theatre).
General Officers who served in the 82d Airborne Division
became commanders of every American Airborne Division
which saw action in World War II, and one became commander
of the only Anerican Airborne Corps formed during the war."
</blockquote>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The documents were scanned from copies left by 
Pvt. George C. Melahn, a U.S. paratrooper who 
served in the 505'th Parachute Infantry Regiment.
<p>
This is a work in progress. 
Scanning is completed for documents related to the 
campaigns in Holland (Operation Market), 
Belgium (The Battle of the Bulge) and the final campaign 
in Central Europe concluding with the defeat and 
unconditional surrender of Germany.
<p>
Scanning is underway for the campaigns in 
Sicily and Normandy (Operation Neptune).
The are also some associated documents such as regimental and divisional newspapers that will be scanned.
