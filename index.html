<h1>82nd Airborne Historical Documents</h1>
<p>
This project contains historical documents 
related to the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division in 
World War II.
<p>
To quote from one of the documents:
<blockquote>
"In the course of these operations tho 82nd Airborne Division became the first American Airborne Division in action and the only Airborne Division to
fight in two Theaters of Operations (the North African
or Mediterranean, and the Europoan Theatre).
General Officers who served in the 82d Airborne Division
became commanders of every American Airborne Division
which saw action in World War II, and one became commander
of the only Anerican Airborne Corps formed during the war."
</blockquote>

Pvt. George C. Melahn, a U.S. paratrooper who 
served in the 505'th Parachute Infantry Regiment.
