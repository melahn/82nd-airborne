<h1>82nd Airborne Division Historical Documents from World War 2</h1>
<p>
This project contains historical documents 
related to the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division in 
World War 2.
<p>
To quote from one of the documents:
<blockquote>
"In the course of these operations the 82nd Airborne Division
became the first American Airborne Division in action and the
only Airborne Division to
fight in two Theaters of Operations (the North African
or Mediterranean, and the European Theatre).
General Officers who served in the 82d Airborne Division
became commanders of every American Airborne Division
which saw action in World War II, and one became commander
of the only Anerican Airborne Corps formed during the war."
</blockquote>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The documents were scanned by Gregory Melahn from copies left by his father
Pvt. George C. Melahn, a U.S. paratrooper who
served in the 505'th Parachute Infantry Regiment in World War 2.
<p>
This is a work in progress. 
Scanning is completed for documents related to the
campaigns in Italy (Operations Husky, Avalanche and Shingle),
Normandy (Operation Neptune),
Holland (Operation Market),
Belgium (The Battle of the Bulge) as well as the final campaign
in Central Europe concluding with the defeat and
unconditional surrender of Germany.
<p>
There are also some associated documents such as regimental and divisional
newspapers that will be scanned.
<p>
The documents are also stored in the Internet Archive.
