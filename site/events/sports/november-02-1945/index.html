<h1>American Football</h1>
<p>
On November 2, 1945 at 14:00 hours, in occupied Berlin, an American Football game was played between
teams from the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment (The 'Panthers')
and 'Special Troops' (Unit unknown). The game was played at
'Panther Stadium' (Location unknown).
<p>
The following week, November 9, 1945 at 14:00 hours,
the final game of the season was played between
the 'Panthers' and a team formed from the Divisional
Artillery. That game was played at the 'Adolph Hitler Sportplatz' (sic).
According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_streets_named_after_Adolf_Hitler">Wikipedia</a>
the Adolf-Hitler-Sport-Platz was at the Ostpreussendamm and Krahmerstrasse,
opposite of Schlosspark Lichterfelde.
It is now a football pitch and there is still a stadium next to it.
