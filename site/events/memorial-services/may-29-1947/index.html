<h1>Memorial Service</h1>
<p>
On Thursday, May 29, 1947, an 82nd Airborne Memorial Service was held in the Oak Room of the Hotel Capitol
located at 8th Avenue & West 51st Street in New York City. The guest speaker was none other than
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_M._Gavin">Major General James M. Gavin</a>, former division commander.
<p>
Here are the pages from the program for that event. These pages were from a copy left by George C. Melahn who
served in the 505'th Parachute Infantry in WW 2. They were digitally scanned by his son Gregory Melahn.
