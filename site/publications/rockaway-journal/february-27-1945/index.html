<h1>February 27, 1945</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Rockaway Journal was a daily newspaper published by the Herald Newspaper Group. 
<p>
These documents were created from copies left by George C. Melahn who served during World War 2
in the 505'th Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR) of the 82nd Airborne Division.
<p>
This particular issue was significant to George because it was his home town newspaper and
reported the death of his twin brother Joseph who
was killed in action in fighting near Schmitt, Germany, on February 11, 1945. George and Joseph Melahn served
in the same squad in the 505th PIR.
<p>
The documents were scanned by his son Gregory Melahn.
