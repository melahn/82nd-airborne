<h1>NYPE News - Welcome Home Edition</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Port_of_Embarkation">New York Port of Embarkation (NYPE)</a> was a U.S. Army Command
responsible for the transportation of military personnel
to their overseas locations.
In 1945, it served as a point of welcome for returning U.S. service personnel coming home from overseas.
<p>
In September of 1945, the  Office of Technical Information of the
NYPE issued a 'Welcome Home' Special Edition of the NYPE News
explaining to the returning troops all the services they would
find at the NYPE and how they would make it to the next point in
their trip home by rail or plane.
