<h1>Italy</h1>
<p>
The 82nd Airborne participated in three operations in Italy. 

The first was an airborne drop 
on Sicily in July of 1943, as part of Operation 'Husky'. This was the first large-scale Allied
airborne operation of World War 2. The second was an airborne drop as part of Operation 'Avalanche',
to secure
the beachhead at Salerno. The third was Operation 'Shingle', an amphibious assault at Anzio.
<p>
The following documents contain a history of these operations.  The documents were written in November of 1945
and include information about the operations in Italy in 1943 and 1944,
but also include summary information
about the Division's in France, Holland, Belgium and Germany in 1944 and 1945.
<p>
    <em>Note 1:</em>All pages of the history, including blank pages and covers, are included. 
    The original paper copies are over seventy years old and the paper is frail and faded.  
    I have done my best to enhance the images to improve the readability
    of the text.  No content was changed.
<p>
    <em>Note 2:</em>The documents were originally classified as 'RESTRICTED' but
    have since been declassified.
