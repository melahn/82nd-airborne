<h1>Operation Market</h1>
<p>
This operation was the Airborne assault in September of 1944 
whose goal was to capture
key bridges in Holland to allow advancing Allied ground forces
(Operation Garden) to cross the Rhine into the Ruhr region of Germany. 
<p>
Three Allied Airborne Divisions were involved: the British 1st Airborne Division, the
U.S. 101st Airborne Division and the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division.
<p>
The objective of the 82nd Airborne Division was to capture two 
bridges across the Waal River at Nijmegen to allow the British ground forces to reach
the British and Polish paratroopers who captured the bridge over the lower 
Rhine at Arnhem.
<p>
The following documents contain a history of the operation created shortly after the end
of the operation and include detailed
narratives and maps describing
activities of the 82nd Airborne Division during this operation.
<p>
    <em>Note 1: </em>All pages of the history, including blank pages and covers, are included. 
    The original paper copies are over seventy years old and the paper is frail and faded.  
    I have done my best to enhance the images to improve the readability
    of the text.  No content was changed.
<p>
    <em>Note 2: </em>The documents have also been uploaded to the
    <a href="https://archive.org/details/82nd-airborne-market-ww-2-melahn-../content/operations/operations">Internet Archive</a>
<p>
    <em>Note 3: </em>The documents were originally classified as 'SECRET' since 
    they were created during wartime but they have since been declassified.
