# 82nd-airborne

This project contains historical documents related to the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division in World War II.

To quote from one of the documents:
> In the course of these operations the 82nd Airborne Division became the first
> American Airborne Division in action and the only Airborne Division to fight in
> two Theaters of Operations (the North African or Mediterranean, and the European
> Theatre). General Officers who served in the 82d Airborne Division became
> commanders of every American Airborne Division which saw action in World War II,
> and one became commander of the only Anerican Airborne Corps formed during the war.

The documents were scanned by Gregory Melahn from copies left by his Father, Pvt. George C. Melahn, a U.S. paratrooper who served in the 505'th Parachute Infantry Regiment.

This is a work in progress.
Scanning is completed for documents related to the
campaigns in Italy (Operations Husky, Avalanche and Shingle),
Normandy (Operation Neptune),
Holland (Operation Market),
Belgium (The Battle of the Bulge) as well as the final campaign
in Central Europe concluding with the defeat and
unconditional surrender of Germany.

There are also some associated documents such as regimental and divisional newspapers that are in the process of being scanned.

The documents are also stored in the Internet Archive.
