This project contains historical documents related to the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division in World War II.

This is a work in progress. Scanning is completed for documents related to the campaigns in Holland (Operation Market), Belgium (The Battle of the Bulge) and the final campaign in Central Europe concluding with the defeat and unconditional surrender of Germany.

Scanning is underway for the campaigns in Sicily and Normandy (Operation Neptune). The are also some associated documents such as regimental and divisional newspapers that will be scanned.
